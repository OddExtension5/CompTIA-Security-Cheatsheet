## Malware

+ **Virus** – replicates using port 1900
+ **Polymorphic virus** – mutates, as does its hash value
+ **Ransomware** – asks for money; could be subtle
+ **Worm** – spreads using port 5000
+ **Trojan** – could change .dll files
+ **Rootkit** – upon reinstalling the OS, it is still there; in Linux, look for the bash shell as a path
+ **Keylogger** – logs keystrokes
+ **Adware** – uses popups
+ **Bots** – infected machine used as an attack vector
+ **RAT** – sends back passwords to the hacker, who then logs in
+ **Logic bomb** – needs a trigger, such as time

## Attacks – Social Engineering

+ **Phishing**– uses email; targets one person
+ **Spear phishing** – attacks a group
+ **Whaling** – attacks CEO or high‐level executives
+ **Vishing** – uses a telephone or leaves a voicemail
+ **Tailgating** – follows someone through; does not use credentials
+ **Impersonating** – pretends to be from the help desk or IT team
+ **Dumpster diving** – pulls information from the trash bin
+ **Shoulder surfing** – someone looks over an employee's shoulder or uses a smartphone to video your bank transaction
+ **Watering hole** – infects a trusted website
+ **Authority** – email from CEO or HR; asks you to fill in a form
+ **Urgency** – letting a fireman into the server room

## Attacks – Application

+ **DoS** – one host taking out another
+ **DDoS** – multiple hosts taking out one host
+ **Man**‐in‐the middle – interception attack data in real time
+ **Replay** – interception attack data replayed at a later date
+ **Kerberos** – prevents replay and pass‐the‐hash attacks
+ **Buffer overflow** – too much data in a field
+ **Integer overflow** – too large a number in a data field
+ **XSS** – uses HTML tags/JavaScript; no authentication
+ **XSRF/CSRF** – asks you to click on an icon and provide authentication
+ **Privilege escalation** – tries to get admin rights
+ **ARP poisoning** – prevented by using static entries in the arp cache—for example, arp ‐s
+ **ARP** – local LAN attack
+ **DNS poisoning** – prevented by using DNSSEC that produces RRSIG records
+ **Man‐in‐the‐browser** – trojan already installed; after bank transactions; URL does not change
+ **Zero‐day virus** – cannot be detected other than baseline; takes more time to get antidote
+ **Pass‐the‐hash** – attacks NTLM authentication; prevented by disabling NTLM or using Kerberos
+ **Session hijacking** – steals your cookies

## Wireless Attacks

+ **Evil twin** – looks like a legitimate WAP
+ **Rogue AP** – free; steals information; prevented by using 802.1x
+ **Jamming** – interference attack
+ **WPS** – push the button; brute-force attacks underlying password
+ **Bluejacking** – hijacks Bluetooth phone; sends text messages
+ **Bluesnarfing** – steals contacts from Bluetooth phone
+ **RFID** – prevents theft of small devices
+ **NFC** – wireless payment; short range
+ **Disassociation attacks** – prevents access to the WAP

## Cryptographic Attacks

+ **Birthday** – hash-collision attack; digital signatures vulnerable
+ **Rainbow tables** – precomputed list of passwords and hashes; used for hash-collision attacks
+ **Dictionary** – password; prevented by using a random character in your password or misspelling your password
+ **Brute force** – every available combination; prevents account lockout low value or salt password
+ **Collison** – matches hashes
+ **Downgrade** – uses legacy SSL rather than TLS; POODLE is a classic example
+ **Weak implementation** – uses WEP; better to use WPA2‐CCMP as it is the strongest

## Threat Actors

+ **Script kiddie** – purchases scripts and programs, probably from the dark web
+ **Hacktivist** – politically motivated agent
+ **Organized crime** – profit-driven agent who will blackmail you
+ **Nation state/APT** – foreign government agent
+ **Insider** – known as a malicious insider; hardest to detect
+ **Competitors** – steals your trade secrets; beats you to market with your product

## Penetration Testing

+ **Intrusive** – can cause damage
+ **Black box** – knows nothing
+ **White box** – knows everything
+ **Gray box** – has at least one piece of information—for example, a password or diagram
+ **Fuzzing** – enters random characters into an application for spurious results; black-/white-box pen testers use it
+ **Pivot** – accesses a network through a vulnerable host, then attacks a secondary, more important host
+ **Initial exploitation** – where pen testing starts
+ **Escalation of privileges** – obtains admin rights
+ **Intrusive scan** – used in pen testing; can cause damage to your system

## Vulnerability Scanning

+ **Passive** – no damage
+ **Credentialed** – admin rights; more information; audit files; account and certificate information
+ **Non‐credentialed** – low level; finds missing patches
+ Identify lack of security controls or misconfiguration

## Vulnerability Impact

+ **Race condition** – two threads accessing data at the same time
+ **End‐of‐life systems** – lack of vendor support; no patches
+ **Error handling** – customer side makes error small; IT support error needs all information
+ **Default configuration** – changes username or passwords
+ **Resource exhaustion** – running CPU at 100% or running out of memory
+ **Untrained users** – not complying with policies
+ **Key management** – ensures keys signed in and out each day
