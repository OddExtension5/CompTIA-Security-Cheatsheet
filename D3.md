## Frameworks and Guides

+ **Regulatory**: Legally enforceable
+ **Non-regulatory**: Not legally enforceable
+ **Industry-specific**: Ensures compliance for that industry
+ **Vendor guides**: How to set up devices/software

## Defense in Depth
**
+ **Multiple controls**: If one control fails, the next control prevents attacks.
+ **Vendor diversity**: When you have the same product from two vendors, if one fails, you are still up and running.
+ **Control diversity**: Use of more than one control, for example, administrative and technical controls working together.

## Secure Network

+ **DMZ**: Boundary layer
+ **Extranet**: Web server residing in DMZ that can be accessed via username and password
+ **Air gaps**: Isolating a system from the network
+ **NAT**: Hides the internal network
+ **Honeypot**: Finds attack methods so that they can be mitigated
+ **Guest Wi-Fi**: Used by guests or employees at lunchtime
+ **VLAN**: Created on a switch, segments the local network, reduced broadcast domain
+ **VPN**: Site-to-site, always-on mode, can be used instead of a lease line
+ **VPN**: Secure connection network from a remote location to work
+ **VPN concentrator**: Sets up a secure session
+ **SSL VPN**: Uses a SSL certificate
+ **SIEM system**: Real-time monitoring, uses a correlation engine
+ **SIEM system**: The wrong input filter produces a false positive
+ **Load balancer**: Manages a high volume of web traffic
+ **Firewall/DDoS mitigator**: Prevents DDoS attacks

## Secure Mobile Devices

+ Screen locks
+ Strong password
+ Full device encryption: Requires a TPM chip
+ Printer/MFD: Can be attacked and is the network interface

## Applications

+ Whitelist: Allowed applications and their EXE files or DLL binaries
+ Blacklist: Banned applications
+ Application not running: 99% of time, add to whitelist
+ Hardened operating system: Has no vulnerabilities

## IoT Devices

+ Change username and password immediately
+ Prevent connecting directly to the internet
+ Difficult firmware updates

## Software Development Life Cycles

+ Waterfall: One stage finishes before the next stage begins
+ Agile: Can start multiple phases, similar to scrum, customer satisfaction paramount
+ Staging: Testing with production data, roll back changes before moving to production
+ White box pen tester: Test application for vulnerabilities

## Embedded Systems

+ SCADA network, water purification, oil and gas refineries
+ IoT: Refrigerator, wearable technology, home automation
+ HVAC: Regulates temperature using hot and cold aisles
+ Camera systems: Captures motion, provides non-repudiation, deterrent and detective controls

## Secure Application Concepts

+ Stored procedure: Sealed script as the best way to prevent SQL injection attacks.
+ Input validation: Controls input, prevents SQL injection, buffer and integer overflow attacks.
+ Baseline: List of applications before and after to see changes. Only method to detect zero-day attacks.
+ Obfuscation: Masks or obscures code.
+ Steganography: Hides data inside other data.
+ Sandboxing: Isolates applications for testing and patching if they are dangerous.

## Cloud Models

+ Elasticity: Pay for the amount of resources you use, easily adjustable
+ Private cloud: Single-tenant, which means more control
+ Public cloud: Multi-tenant
+ Community cloud: Same industry sharing the cost of resources

## Cloud Services

+ IaaS: Desktops, servers, switches, firewall, or pbx
+ IaaS: Install OS, patch and configure it – more control
+ SaaS: Lease bespoke application – no customization
+ PaaS: Hosts your applications – you manage and customize
+ SECaaS: Identity management

## Cloud Miscellaneous

+ VDI: Isolated desktop for contractors or employees
+ CASB: Enforces policies for cloud clients

## Virtualization

+ Type I hypervisor: Bare-metal, Hyper V, ESX, Zen
+ Type II hypervisor: Install on an OS, for example, Oracle Virtual Box
+ Host: Hosts virtual machines, needs fast disk space, CPU cores, and RAM
+ System sprawl: Host/guest running out of resources
+ Guest: A user's virtual machine
+ Containers: Isolated guest
+ Sandboxing: Isolated application for testing, patching, or because it is dangerous
+ Chroot Jail: Linux sandbox
+ Snapshot: Used for rolling back guests, fastest backup
+ VM sprawl: Unmanaged guest
+ VM escape: Attacks the host

## Resiliency and Automation

+ Master image: Produces a consistent baseline
+ Non-persistent configuration: Can be rolled back
+ RAID 5: Single parity and can lose one disk, 3-32 disks
+ RAID 6: Double parity and can lose two disks
+ Continuous monitoring: Alerts you immediately
+ Snapshots: Virtual machines revert back to an earlier state

## Physical Security Controls

+ Security guards: Check the identification of people, prevents access
+ HVAC: Regulates temperature using hot and cold aisles
+ Protected distribution: Protects cables
+ Conduits: Protect cables
+ Faraday cables: Prevents emissions of data and wireless leaving or entering a network
+ Cable locks: Prevent the theft of mobile devices
+ Mantrap: Prevents access to buildings or data centers
+ Screen filters: Prevents shoulder surfing
+ Key management: Prevents keys being taken away overnight and from being cut
