## Risk Treatments

+ Avoidance – risk deemed too high. Avoid activity.
+ Acceptance – risk too low – do not mitigate
+ Mitigation – reduce the risk; for example, anti-virus on laptop
+ Transference – transfer risk to a third party; for example, outsourcing, car insurance

## Risk Assessment

+ Stage 1 – identify the asset – determine how it is treated and handled
+ Quantitative – measurement of loss expressed in a number format
+ Qualitative – grading risk as high, medium, or low
+ SLE – single loss of an item
+ ARO – number of losses in a year
+ ALE – SLE x ARO = annual losses in a year
+ Residual risk – remaining risk after mitigation

## Personnel Management

+ Mandatory vacations – employee takes a holiday; the employer discovers fraud or theft
+ Job rotation – trains the staff also detect fraud or theft
+ Separation of duties – no one person completes the whole transaction
+ Exit interview – find reasons for leaving the company
+ Off-boarding – returning your company equipment on exit
+ Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) – legal agreement to not discuss company business

## Business Impact Analysis

+ RPO – the amount of time you can be without data, acceptable downtime
+ RTO – returning to full operation after a disaster
+ MTTR – time to repair
+ MTBF – time between failures; measures reliability of a system
+ Single point of failure – one item, if it fails, takes the system down

## Forensics

+ Stage 1 – hard drive – take a forensic copy
+ Stage 1 – computer – take a system image
+ Order of volatility – collect perishable evidence first
+ Record time offset – regional time of evidence that is collected
+ Time normalization – putting the record time offsets in sequence
+ Chain of custody – who collected and has handled the evidence, should not have a gap
+ Rapidly expanding virus – isolate or quarantine immediately

## Recovery Sites

+ Hot – manned with all data up to date, most expensive site
+ Warm – manned data maybe 3 hours out of date
+ Cold – water and electricity – no equipment, cheapest site

## Data Destruction

+ Hard drive – shred first, then pulverize, then degauss
+ Paper – pulp first, shred second
+ Paper – classified – use a burning bag, obtain destruction certificate
