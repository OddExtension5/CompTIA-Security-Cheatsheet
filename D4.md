## Authentication Factors

+ **Something you know**: Password, PIN, birth date
+ **Something you are**: Iris, retina, fingerprint, palm, voice
+ **Something you do**: Swipe, gait, signature
+ **Somewhere you are**: Location, London, Poland
+ **Single factor**: All from the same group
+ **Dual factor**: From more than one group

## Federation Services

+ Third-party to third-party authentication
+ Uses extended attributes
+ **SAML**: XML-based
+ **Shibboleth**: Open source using cookies
+ **RADIUS federation**: Federation services connecting via wireless

## AAA

+ RADIUS: UDP port 1812
+ RADIUS accounting port 1813
+ DIAMETER: Upgrade of RADIUS using EAP
+ TACACS+ - Cisco AAA: TCP port 49
+ RADIUS accounting: Logs and tracks users

## Authentication Types

+ Kerberos: Uses tickets, prevents replay and pass-the-hash attacks
+ OAuth: Uses tokens
+ Federation services: Uses cookies
+ Open ID Connect: Uses a Facebook or Google account and needs OAuth
+ Context-aware: Based on location

## Account Types

+ User: For employees
+ Service: For applications
+ Privileged: For service technicians and administrators
+ Generic/default: Change immediately
+ Identity: Smart card or username
+ Authentication: Password or PIN
+ Authorization: Access levels

## Account Policy Enforcement

+ Password history: Prevents reuse of a password
+ Password length: The longer the better; increases the compute time for brute-force attacks
+ Complexity: Three from uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters not used in programming
+ Account lockout: With low value prevents brute-force attacks
+ Account expiry: Required for the length of the employee's contract

## Access Control Models

+ MAC: Based on classification, the owner gives classification and the administrator gives access
+ DAC: NTFS permissions
+ ABAC: Based on a user's attributes
+ Role-based access control: Subset of the department, a subset of duties
+ Rule-based access control: Applies to the whole organization

## Physical Access Control

+ Smart cards
+ Proximity cards
+ Tokens
+ TOTP: Needs a device to display code

## Biometrics

+ FAR: Allows unauthorized access
+ FRR: Prevents authorized access
+ CER: Where FAR and FRR are equal; low value shows working well

## General Concepts

+ Least privilege: Allocates only the rights for the job role
+ Off-boarding: Claims back company equipment
+ Exit interview: Carried out by HR to determine the reason for leaving
+ Standard naming convention: Structure for new accounts, printers, and computers
+ Permission auditing and reviews: Ensures employees have the correct level of permissions
