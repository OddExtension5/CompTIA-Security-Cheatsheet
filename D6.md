## Certificate Hierarchy

+ CA has a root key
+ Stage 1—do you want to install a public or private CA
+ Public CA required for trading on the internet (B2B)
+ Architect builds the CA and intermediary authorities
+ Intermediary authorities issue the certificates
+ Certificate pinning—prevents CA compromise and fraudulent certificates

## Certificate Validation

+ Certificate Revocation List (CRL)—checks certificate validity
+ OCSP—used only when the CRL is going slow
+ Certificate stapling—when the web server bypasses the CRL and goes directly to the OCSP

## Private Keys

+ Always retained—never given away
+ P12 format, .pfx extension, password protected
+ Used to decrypt data
+ Used to digitally sign email—provides integrity
+ Key Escrow—holds the private keys for third parties
+ **Hardware Security Module (HSM)**—stored and manages the keys for the Key Escrow
+ **Data Recovery Agent (DRA)**—obtains private keys from the Key Escrow to recover data

## Public Keys

+ Used to encrypt data—normally use someone else's to send encrypted data to them
+ Exchange with others
+ P7B format or .cer extension

## Trust Models

+ Two different PKIs trusting each other—bridge root of trust
+ PGP—uses a web of trust
+ TPM—hardware root of trust

## Miscellaneous

+ Object Identifier (OID)—unique numerical value equivalent to a serial number
+ PEM—Base64 certificate
+ Extended validation—higher level of trust, green background when used
+ Certificate chaining—three levels showing the vendor, CA, and computer installed on
+ Wildcard certificate—used for multiple servers in the same domain, also used by host headers
+ Subject Alternate Domain (SAN)—used for multiple domain names
+ Certificate Signing Request (CSR)—application for new certificates

## Cryptographic Algorithms

+ Encryption—asymmetric or symmetric—exchange keys
+ Stream cipher—encrypt one bit at a time
+ Block cipher—encrypt blocks of data

## Symmetric Encryption

+ Single key—private or shared key
+ Encrypts a large amount of data
+ Encrypts data-at-rest
+ DES—56 bits
+ 3DES—168 bits
+ AES—up to 256 bits
+ Blowfish—64 bits
+ Twofish—128 bits

## Asymmetric Encryption

+ Two keys—public and private
+ Diffie Hellman—create a secure tunnel
+ RSA
+ Elliptic curve—used for small devices
+ PGP—encryption between two people

## Ephemeral Key

+ Short-live—one-time use
+ Diffie Hellman Ephemeral (DHE)
+ Elliptic curve Diffie Hellman Ephemeral (DHE)

## Hashing

+ Provides data integrity
+ SHA1 160 bits
+ MD5 128 bits
+ Hash before and after—data integrity produces the same hash
+ Rainbow tables—precomputed password and associated hashes
+ Collision attack—two hash values match
+ TLS—data-in-transit

## Key Stretching

+ Increases compute time for brute force attacks
+ Key stretching tools—bcrypt, PBKDF2

## Basic Cryptographic Concepts

+ Obfuscation—masks data so it cannot be read if stolen
+ Steganography—embeds or hides data inside other data
+ Salting—appends a random value to passwords
+ Salting—prevents duplicate passwords being stored
+ Salting—reduces the effectiveness of a brute force attack
+ Data-in-transit—use TLS or VPN to protect it
+ Data-at-rest—use encryption such as AES/DES/3DES
+ Data-in-use —resides in volatile RAM.
+ Key strength—smaller the key size the faster but less secure it is

## Wireless Security – Low to High

+ WEP—very weak
+ WPA—backward-compatible with WEP
+ WPA2—CCMP—strongest wireless encryption—uses AES
+ WPA2—enterprise—RADIUS with 802.1x for domains
+ PSK—press shared key
+ TKIP—legacy
+ WPS—push button to activate, insert password first
+ WPS and PSK—can be subject to brute force attack
+ Disable SSID—can be discovered by a wireless packet sniffer
+ Troubleshoot Wi-Fi—use wireless packet sniffer/scanner
+ Site survey—needed before setting up WLAN

## Wireless Authentication

+ Guest Wi-Fi—used by visitors or employees at lunchtime
+ Open system authentication—no security
+ Captive portal—request secondary information to connect
+ EAP-TL—certificate on the endpoint
+ EAP-TTLS—certificate on the server
+ EAP-FAST—mutual authentication, no certificate
+ PEAP—encapsulates EAP packets, uses TLS
