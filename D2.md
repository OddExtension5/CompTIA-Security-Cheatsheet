## Access Control Lists (ACLs)

+ Firewalls and routers use ACL. No allow rule means implicit deny.

## Firewalls

+ Unified Threat Management (UTM)– all in one URL and content filter
+ **Stateful firewall** – inspect deep into the packet, including size and commands
+ **Stateful firewall** – protects against DDoS attacks
+ **Web application firewall** – protect the web server and web applications
+ **Host-based** – only protects the local computer
+ **Network-based** – only protects the network

## Network Protection

+ **Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS)** – additional layer of protection placed close to firewall
+ **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** – detects changes in network, uses sensor and collectors, and alerts the NIPS
+ **Signature-based** – work from a local database
+ **Anomaly-based** – start with a database but can learn new patterns

## Proxy Server

+ URL filter
+ Content filter
+ Caches web pages

## Reverse Proxy

+ Authenticates incoming connections
+ Decrypts incoming traffic

## Load Balancer

+ Deals with a high load of web traffic
+ Sends traffic to the least utilized host
+ Affinity – sends the host to the same web server
+ Round robin – balances traffic using DNS A records

## SIEM System

+ Real-time monitoring
+ Correlates events on the network
+ Measures account lockout, even with attempts on different computers
+ Needs the correct filter, otherwise false position

## Tools

+ **Packet sniffer/protocol analyzer** – analyze network traffic
+ **Banner grabbing** – analyze web server
+ **Banner grabbing** – three main tools: Telnet, Nmap, and Netcat (nc)
+ **Nmap** – maps out whole network – identifies new hosts
+ **NAC** – ensures network clients are fully patched
+ **DLP** – prevents exfiltration of PII, sensitive information, or credit card details
+ **Mail gateway** – filters out spam
+ **Wireless scanner** – troubleshoots WAP problems
+ **Wireless scanner and SSID decloak device** – finds the SSID even if it's disabled
+ **Password cracker** – can find the hash of a password
+ **Honeypot** – looks like a legitimate website with lower security

## Data Sanitization Tools

+ **Hard drive** – best to worst:  shred, pulverize, then degauss
+ **Paper** – best to worst: pulping then shredding
+ **Paper** – classified – burn bag – destroy by third party – certificate given
+ **Honeypot** – analyzes attack methods being used

## Command-Line Tools

+ **Netstat** – shows established connection
+ **Netcat (nc)** – shows established connections on Linux
+ **Tcpdump** – Linux packet analyzer
+ **Nslookup** – troubleshoot DNS issues
+ **DIG – Linux** – troubleshoot DNS issues

## Mobile Devices

+ **Mobile device management** – policies and management of mobile devices
+ **Download manager** – controls download speed
+ **Remote wipe** – lost or stolen devices – back to factory reset
+ **Camera** – can record videoconferencing, conversations, or take pictures
+ **Protect access** – screen locks and strong passwords
+ **Protect data at rest** –  FDE – Full Disk Encryption or small devices Full Device Encryption
+ **Containerization/storage segmentation** – separates private and business data
+ **BYOD** – needs AUP and on/offboarding policies
+ **Geofencing** – prevent theft of devices
+ **Geolocation** – shows the location of the device
+ **Carrier unlocking** – jailbreaking/rooting followed by sideloading the app
