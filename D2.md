## Access Control Lists (ACLs)

+ Firewalls and routers use ACL. No allow rule means implicit deny.

## Firewalls

+ Unified Threat Management (UTM)– all in one URL and content filter
+ Stateful firewall – inspect deep into the packet, including size and commands
+ Stateful firewall – protects against DDoS attacks
+ Web application firewall – protect the web server and web applications
+ Host-based – only protects the local computer
+ Network-based – only protects the network

## Network Protection

+ Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS) – additional layer of protection placed close to firewall
+ Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) – detects changes in network, uses sensor and collectors, and alerts the NIPS
+ Signature-based – work from a local database
+ Anomaly-based – start with a database but can learn new patterns

## Proxy Server

+ URL filter
+ Content filter
+ Caches web pages

## Reverse Proxy

+ Authenticates incoming connections
+ Decrypts incoming traffic

## Load Balancer

+ Deals with a high load of web traffic
+ Sends traffic to the least utilized host
+ Affinity – sends the host to the same web server
+ Round robin – balances traffic using DNS A records

## SIEM System

+ Real-time monitoring
+ Correlates events on the network
+ Measures account lockout, even with attempts on different computers
+ Needs the correct filter, otherwise false position
